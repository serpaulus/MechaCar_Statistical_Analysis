## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The  linear Regression to Predict MPG results show:

1)  Vehicle weight, spoiler angle and the AWD transmission provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset
2) The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-value is 5.35e-11 which smaller than 0.05
3) The linear model does not predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because  the values that provide a non-random amount of variance have a week correlation Pr value
